    "There are many strategies to select words that will minimize the number of guesses that a player needs to make: choose a word with as many unguessed letters as possible, to obtain information about each letter; maximize choices to consist of the most common letters; maximize choices to consist of letters in their most frequent positions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is this.  Given a list of acceptable words in \"English_words.txt\" (we're changing things up a bit, and giving you words of length *6*, instead of length 5), decide upon a strategy to choose the most likely solution. You are free to use any strategy you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely want to write functions that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read a list of words into a data structure\n",
    "2. perform some statistical analysis of the data\n",
    "3. update the list, given the response of the Wordle game.  All you need to know about the algorithm is that it will accept a suggestion for the word, and will return a list that will correspond to one of the three options cited above.  For example, if the solution is \"parse\", and you provide \"morph\", the algorithm will return. [-1,-1,1,0,-1] (ie, the character at position \"2\" is true, and the one at position \"3\" is a false position; everything else is a false prediction). You will likely need to make different decisions, depending on the results.  You are *strongly* encouraged to test this functionality thoroughly.\n",
    "4. If you have guessed the word (ie, the return of the algorithm is [1,1,1,1,1]), then you are done, and you have won the game!  Good job!  If not, then you will need to recalculate the most likely word, given your strategy."

    "Gitksan is the language of the Gitxsan people of British Columbia.  It belongs to the Tsimshianic language family, and has far fewer speakers than English.  The traditional territories consist of 50,000 square km in the Skeena river watershed (pictured below).  The language is written using a modified version of the Latin alphabet, with both digraphs/trigraphs (two/three letters that represent one sound, like 'th' in English) and diacritics (accents or markings that change the meaning of the letter).  For example, \"hl\" is considered one letter, representing a single sound, as is <ins>k</ins>.  The letters used in Gitksan are as follow (sourced from : Gitksan, by Jason Brown, Henry Davis, Michael Schwan and Barbara Sennott).  Thanks to the Gitksan Lab in the UBC department of Linguistics for providing the dictionary, and being very enthusiastic about this coding problem.  \n",
